Download the TrendViz folder. 

In terminal, navigate to the TrendViz directory. 

Create a viz by running trendviz.py with two arguments:1) timescale (e.g. day, week, month, quarter, year) and 2) coin (e.g., bitcoin, ethereum, monero, bitcoin-cash)


For example, to get a viz of Bitcoin over the last year, type: python trendviz.py year bitcoin

I only tested this on a Linux machine, sorry if there are issues with Windows or Mac.
